Here, the hair on one side of my head is curling under on one side, and just seems very thick/poofy on the other.

    <p>Sometimes i want to cry while my hair is drying and i&#039;m just watching the left side. That is, the top layer is straight and the bottom layer is curled. So, up until recently i&#039;ve had hair down to my butt, and my hair is very thick, so even though it was curly the weight just pulled them out and made them look wavy. It concerns me, because a friend of mine here in vegas, her sister died at age 42 from cancer a few years ago. Get you a boar hair brush for the sides, and a round brush as it gets longer.</p>
