    <p><strong>What Is A Zero Sum Game In Game Theory</strong>, In these games, one player gains if and only if another player loses. Hence, the benefits gained by each player adds to zero. A constant sum game can be converted into a zero sum game by subtracting a fixed value from all payoffs, leaving their relative order unchanged.</p>
