    <p>Engineered floors with a thin veneer typically cannot be refinished, however, many modern engineered wood floors are made with a thicker veneer that makes refinishing possible. This, in turn, affects how, when and where they can be used. In australia, the hybrid flooring cost per square meter is around $40 to $50. Engineered hardwood and vinyl plank both have a wear layer. So the species can be cherry, oak, maple, or hickory.</p>
