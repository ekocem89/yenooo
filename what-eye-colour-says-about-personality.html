    <p>When we say black eyes we mean people whose brown eyes whose color is so rich and dark it can read as black. Green is the color of nature and emphasizes a direct connection with the world. People with light blue, green, brown or grey eyes are more sensitive to sunlight, which magically endows them with a sensitivity toward other. A study published by the journal personality and individual differences says that people with very dark eyes tend to drink considerably less than those with lighter eyes and that they’re generally better at sports that involve hitting targets (like tennis). In a study published in plos one, researchers asked 238 volunteers to rate photographs of people for trustworthiness.</p>
