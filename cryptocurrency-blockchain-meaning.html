    <p><strong>Cryptocurrency Blockchain Meaning</strong>, A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum are powered by a technology called the blockchain. Cryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all transactions updated and held by currency holders.</p>

        But blockchain transcends cryptocurrency applications. They do so by contributing their computational power, which in return, is able to support the network. Since the entire blockchain is developed using the principles of asymmetric cryptography, it was wise to call bitcoin or any mode of exchange on a blockchain, a cryptocurrency.
