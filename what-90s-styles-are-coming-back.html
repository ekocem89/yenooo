    <p>Today, however, the style can look outdated. Today, many people modernize the look by pairing them with jean shorts or throwing them over a tee and jazzing it. There’s a bomber jacket for everyone. Moreover, leather jackets are among the trends that are making a huge comeback. It’s amazing that something as simple as a comfy flannel shirt was one of the most popular style moves of the 90s—and we want them back.</p>
