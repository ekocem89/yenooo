    <p>This is what causes the bald patches in many dogs. According to webmd, a reaction to flea saliva injected when a flea bites a dog is the most common cause of dog allergies. With these types of movements, it’s no wonder your pup may experience a bit of hair loss. Fungus, mites, ticks, fleas, and bacteria can cause infections that eventually lead to hair loss around the eyes and other parts of your dog’s body. When hair loss is noted around the eyes with no itch and no other symptoms, this is generally the first sign of demodectic mange.</p>
