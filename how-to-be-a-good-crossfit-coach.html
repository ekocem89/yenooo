    <p>My only advice if you are still married to crossfit is to try to get away from daily metcons. As a games level coach, you have to know why you are programming what you are programming. Being successful at the crossfit open means that you should be able to perform at a high intensity for around 15 minutes. Therefore, you want to find a gym that focuses on having good people all around rather than one that focuses on just the best people. A minimum starting point would be to set aside 30 minutes every day for learning.</p>
