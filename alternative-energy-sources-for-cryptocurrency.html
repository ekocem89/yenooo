    <p>Another potential solution is to transition cryptocurrency networks away from energy sources that contribute to climate change. The major issue with this form of alternative energy is that it is mostly derived from the use of natural gas and fossil fuels. Behind hydroelectricity, coal (38%) and natural gas (36%) are the energy sources hashers favour most. Nuclear energy as a source for mining bitcoin. Some argue that many miners are already using renewable energy.</p>
