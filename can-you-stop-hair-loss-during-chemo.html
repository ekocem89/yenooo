While adjusting to your new locks, it is highly recommended to not dye your hair for the first 6 months after chemo is complete. Cooling caps are one of the most effective ways that have been studied to minimize hair loss during chemotherapy. After chemo stops and your follicles are healthy, your hair should start to grow back. Raw, organic coconut oil is an option.</p>
