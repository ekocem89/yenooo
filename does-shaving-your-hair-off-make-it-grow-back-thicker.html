    <p><strong>Does Shaving Your Hair Off Make It Grow Back Thicker</strong>, Many mums swear by the importance of shaving to make way for healthier, silkier tresses. No matter where it grows on your body, shaving does not cause hair to grow back thicker or darker. (it doesn’t.) and we worry that shaving or cutting it will make hair grow back thicker or darker or coarser.</p>

        After a shave, the hair all grows through together at the same time very bluntly, because it has been cut with a blade, says scriminger. The mayo clinic states that shaving hair won’t change its color. No matter where it grows on your body, shaving does not cause hair to grow back thicker or darker.
    </p>
    <h3>Does shaving make hair grow back thicker? Hair Cut Across many asian cultures, it&#039;s a common belief passed from mum to mum:</h3>

    <p>Heser adds, “the shorter the hair is, the easier it is to see each millimeter of growth.” The very act of cutting may make hair appear thicker for a short time. Understand that shaving or the removal of unwanted hair does not change the process of hair regrowth. When boys first start shaving, the hair might gradually come back thicker, however that&#039;s got nothing to do with shaving itself. So while your regrowth may not actually be thicker or stronger, it can certainly feel like it.</p>
