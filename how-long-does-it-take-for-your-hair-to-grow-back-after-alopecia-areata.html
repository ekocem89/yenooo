    <p>Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease that causes patchy or complete hair loss, including on the head, body, eyebrows and eyelashes. I was wondering who out there has had long term hair loss. The good news is the majority of telogen effluvium cases are over in about three to six months, when those additional hairs that were prematurely shifted into telogen have shed. Usually, the bald patches appear suddenly and affect only a limited area. Once a hair comes out of the follicle, it generally then reverts back to the growing phrase (so long as there is not some autoimmune or androgen mechanism taking place as in disorders like alopecia areata or aga where the follicle is being attacked or compromised.)</p>
