        If you are deep in the crypto space, you will probably come to the point where you may want to understand whether cryptocurrency is considered a security or commodity. Crypto platforms currently list both crypto commodity tokens and crypto security tokens, including crypto tokens that are investment contracts and/or notes. Traditional commodities and securities play an important role in the world economy to grow businesses and accumulate wealth.

    <h3>Cryptocurrencies | Commodity Or Security? Is your favorite cryptocurrency a security or a commodity, and if it’s the latter, will the commodities regulator be looking at it soon?</h3>

    <p>The world’s social media platforms and financial markets are abuzz about cryptocurrencies and “initial coin offerings” ( icos ). If your coins give more value out of their derivative products, they are likely to be considered a commodity. This has become a pertinent question for investors even as ripple continues to square off with the securities regulator in the u.s over whether xrp is a security. For ethereum, the debate has revolved around whether ethereum’s cryptocurrency, ether, should be classified as a commodity or a security. Wikipedia defines a commodity as a “marketable item produced to satisfy wants or needs.”.</p>
