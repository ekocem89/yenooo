Over time, hair is lost faster than it can grow, resulting in a receding hairline and baldness. The causes of thinning hair on the sides include traction alopecia, heredity, and certain diseases.

DELAWARE SCALP MICROPIGMENTATION, There are actually quite a few threads that have been brought up about this subject and it seems that most experience some sort of uneven hair loss.

I don&#039;t know what your hair has looked like historically. Just like mpd, it’s a result of hormonal imbalances and typically starts causing bald patches around.
