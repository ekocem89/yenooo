    <p>Treated hairs tend to curl up and fall out on their own or get removed through exfoliating the skin and showering. As a result, the hair does not begin to regrow right away. If you have postpartum hair loss, or hair loss after pregnancy, you&#039;ll notice a sudden shedding — sometimes in clumps — in the six months after you give birth. If your hair does not regain its normal fullness after one year, you may want to see a dermatologist. Rest assured that this is normal and temporary, and that this rate of hair loss will not continue.</p>
