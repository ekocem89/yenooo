    <p><strong>Why Does My Daughter Have Curly Hair</strong>, The hair you have at 5 years of age will most likely be different at age 15, 25 and 50. My dad is a red head (and do am i) and you can imagine his curls, but my mom has pencil straight hair. Why does my hair curl at the end.</p>

        <p>
        In a year i could have rebonded my hair twice. “curly hair tangles easily because it tends to be drier, which can cause the curls to mat together.” avoid knots in the shower by washing your hair in sections and in a downward motion with a gentle shampoo. Presumably if we’d both gotten a “curl” gene, our hair would have the same texture.
    </p>
    <h3>My Natural Hair Daughters WASH DAY Curly Coily Hair I also put her hair in a braidr b4 she goes to sleep and it cuts down on the tangles.</h3>

    <p>Because you inherited the straight hair gene from your dad. Most hair does not change drastically, although it has been known to happen. The fact of the matter is that curly hair takes a longer time to grow longer because it grows in a curl, rather than straight down. I use a leave in conditoner once i comb her hair out and it helps. But curly hair, as well as straight hair, usually grows about 1/2” per month.</p>
