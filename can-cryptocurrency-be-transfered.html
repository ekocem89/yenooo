        I consent to my submitted data being collected via this form* The answer to this question is yes because until the new robinhood crypto wallet is fully rolled out, your only option for getting your crypto assets over to the coin base is just to sell what you have in the robin hood. Currently, many platforms carryout crypto transactions since crypto transactions are no longer limited to exchanges or crypto wallets.

    <p>So here is my question: If bitcoins are earmarked on the wallet, they can be sold on the desired platform. They are not a chose in possessions (i.e., a tangible personal property that can be possessed or transferred), since they are virtual and not tangible items. These items should not be distributed to any person until such time as the cryptocurrency, digital cash, or any information related to the access of my cryptocurrency is transferred to [beneficiary named above]. Ways crypto can support money transfers.</p>
