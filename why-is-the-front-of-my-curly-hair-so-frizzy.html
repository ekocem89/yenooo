    <p><strong>Why Is The Front Of My Curly Hair So Frizzy</strong>, First all you may need a cut, evaluate the length of the damage and cut as much as you need and afterwards get regular trims. The only other times you can comb your curls is after applying a leave in conditioner (explained later in this post) outside the shower and sometimes with oil applied to your hair before you shower. The diy remedy is to run dryer sheets over your hair to remove the static and at the same time calm down the frizz.</p>

        The main cause of frizz is lack of moisture in the hair. So, let’s start with the list. Be sure to wash your scalp rigorously with your shampoo and rinse, rinse and more rinse with very warm water, then condition.
    </p>
    <h3>Only the front part of my hair is curly and the rest is I love how my curls are looking so far with my new routine (new products, conditioning upside down, lots of deep conditioning, microfiber towels, and plopping).</h3>

    <p>If it doesn’t, then you may either have to cut bangs or find styles that don’t require that part to be curly, like flat. An easy way to combat this is simply to use some sort of shine agent after you dry your hair. When sulfates are used in lathering, cleansing products, they can deplete hair of its natural surface oils, leaving it feeling rough, dry and brittle. To prevent frizz from dominating the top layer of hair, you must hydrate and nourish it deeply. Why is my hair always dry and frizzy ?</p>
