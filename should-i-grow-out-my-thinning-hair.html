Most people with fine hair are always going for volume which means they are always going for looks that simply don’t work for their natural texture. However, the thickness of your hair doesn’t change. As well, stress and poor diet are some of the.</p>

                    <p align="justify">How often should you cut your hair if you want it to grow, Long hair (past the shoulders) will help create the illusion of a more elongated face. My first clue as to why you shouldn&#039;t get layers was how quickly my hair fell flat after i got my cut. The shorter the layers the more volume you get. Many men will notice their hair thinning when they are still in their 20s.</p>
