    <p><strong>Does Colouring Cause Hair Loss</strong>, Unless you’ve gotten right down to the roots of your hair (and please don’t allow your stylist to do that), you haven’t messed with the chemistry that regulates hair loss… directly. To minimize the chance of such damage, use dye within three shades of your natural hair color (see reference 1). It is true that colouring your hair makes it dull and more vulnerable to breakage and loss but, it does not cause premature greying.</p>

        <p>
        If you have bleach applied to your hair and it causes damage (also incorrectly cared for following) it could cause breakage (perceived as hair loss often) or in a very small cases a burn to the scalp. It is recommended that you test any hair product on a small part of your scalp to identify any reactions to avoid hair loss from hair dye. Coloring your hair also requires heavy combing and rubbing, which can also contribute to hair loss because this manipulation can loosen the hair treated with dye.

    <p>Moreover, it can further lead to dryness, breakage, and split ends, which can cause hair loss. Yes, coloring your hair can lead to hair loss, but this would be considered unusual. Don&#039;t leave dye in for more than the recommended amount of time. It is recommended that you test any hair product on a small part of your scalp to identify any reactions to avoid hair loss from hair dye. Colouring hair is not usually a problem.</p>
