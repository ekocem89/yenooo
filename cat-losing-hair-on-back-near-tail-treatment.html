    <p><strong>Cat Losing Hair On Back Near Tail Treatment</strong>, Without treatment, hair loss around the tail in cats often leads to localized balding which leaves the coat of the felines in an unsightly state. These small parasites force cats to bite and scratch too much, resulting in hair loss. In cats, the most affected area of their skin is mainly around the base of their tail and the lower spine, but the flanks, neck, and belly may also be affected.</p>

        “a cat&#039;s tail has multiple functions,” says teri skadron, doctor of veterinary medicine at skadron animal hospital in west st. Usually, the problem is caused by your cat suffering a reaction to the saliva of the flea and a localised reaction occurs, particularly on the back, towards the tail. This is probably due to a severe allergy, although it could also be fleas, infection or mites.
    </p>
    <h3>Psychogenic Alopecia Cat Losing Hair On Legs The skin surrounding the area of hair loss can appear normal, or it can have redness, bumps, scabs and skin loss.</h3>

    <p>The next morning, put this mix into a spray bottle and then apply it to the entirety of your cat’s head, legs, torso, and tail. Rather than being a specific disease, miliary dermatitis is a skin reaction pattern. This type of alopecia generally occurs on the inner forelimbs, the rear area of the abdomen, the groin region, the tail and/or the lower back area, and it may or may not be symmetric. This is common in dogs, but uncommon in cats. Need some help at tackling the issue of cat losing hair at base of tail.</p>
