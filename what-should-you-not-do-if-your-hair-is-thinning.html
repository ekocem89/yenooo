A curly hair stylist might talk to you about introducing carefully placed layers to shape your curls or she might suggest an undercut. If you can see your scalp through your hair (especially when you run your hands through it), this could be a sign your hair is thinning.</p>

    <p>The right conditioner, however, can provide significant advantages for your thin hair. You can buy it over the counter without a prescription. Also, most of the hair oils are only like an external conditioner and cannot get absorbed into the scalp.

That&#039;s a hormone most related to male pattern baldness in men and some women.</p>
