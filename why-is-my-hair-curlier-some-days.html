                    <p align="justify">Kinky Curly Curling Custard.... There are no words for how, Underneath my canopy in back i have 3b spirals. Layers are a great way to define your curls, coils, waves, and ringlets. When i was 11 or 12 years old the down part of my hair started to curl a lot around my ears and at the back. If i air dry my hair, it takes nearly the whole day.</p>

Find help with your hair. All hair is good hair. And unless you&#039;re a person with tightly coiled curls, they often can&#039;t bounce back. Why is the underneath of my hair curlier?</p>

                    <p align="justify">Why I Cut INCHESSSS Off My Long Curly Hair YouTube, As the week progresses, my hair gets curlier, nicely formed clumps with spirals, some nice waves, decent volume. Why is my hair curly underneath but straight on top? Do layers make your hair curlier? Blowdrying and flat ironing my hair straight every morning. My hair is definitely curlier and the top is much curlier too probably due to the weight.</p>
