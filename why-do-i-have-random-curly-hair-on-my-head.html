    <p>Instead of your usual routine, try a few things to see if you actually have wavy or curly hair. Or you may have your hair cut to encourage the straight sections to fall on top of the curly ones to wear down the curls. You will lose volume if. You might be using your conditioner incorrectly, from roots to the ends. Now we all know that certain races have similar hair textures and the reason for that is pretty interesting.</p>
