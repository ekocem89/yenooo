    <p>Female hair loss can be scary. When hair is very short, it hides very well the fact that it is thin. The concept behind keeping hair short or getting a hair cut to slow hair loss is not as routinely as it sounds. However, excessive hair loss may be a sign that you have telogen effluvium, a form of shedding that can cause you to lose hairs early in their growth cycle. When it is short, it may fall in the same quantity, but you almost don&#039;t see it.</p>
